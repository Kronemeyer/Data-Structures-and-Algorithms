Algorithms and Data Structures

## Project 1
Given a file with an unspecified length of numbers, continuously calculate the total slices of pizza eaten by 4 turtles. Introductory project meant as a way to ensure our c++ environment was correctly set up.

## Project 2
Recursive function to find the solution to cryptarithmic puzzles. Ex. SEND + MORE = MONEY

## Project 3
This file was created to demonstrate the Karatsuba Algorithm when compared tothe generic gradeschool algorithm. The algorithm uses integer vectors throughout so custom vector addition and subtraction had to be implemented.

## Project 4
Given any string input, the string will be parsed to find all possible palindromes within that string. Single characters count as palindromes, however longer palindromes will be prioritized when discovered. The program outputs the number of splits found in that string, along with the palindromes split by a "|" character.

Ex. 
* Input: "racecar" will output 0 splits: racecar
* Input: "racecarbob" will output 1 split: racecar | bob
* Input: "abc" will output 2 splits: a|b|c
